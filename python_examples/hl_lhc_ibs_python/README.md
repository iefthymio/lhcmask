# HL-LHC simulation using pymask

The code simulates the HL-LHC collisions at FT for Run 4 and evaluates the IBS parameters for the emittance growth.

**Optics used**: HLLHCV1.5 

Note: 
The pymask offers the framework for the use of MAD-X for the simulations. It is assumed that the users should modify the files in this directory for each case. Namely;
- the parameters in the config.py 
- the code in the 000_pymask.py 
- the functions in optics_specific_tools.py. 

This is a minimal initial set of files to work.
